This documnet describes how to build use this Docker image

**********************************************************************************************************
This Docker image is created to host Android Studio, Tensorflow 2.3 and SNPE SDk V1.41.  This is meant to provide a consistent build environment for validate and benchmark Android apps using SNPE SDK.
**********************************************************************************************************

***********************
Prerequisition:
***********************
System with Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04, with Docker 20 installed (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

***********************
Build the Docker image
***********************
1. Unzip the android-studio-dockerfile.zip into a working folder.  There will be a Dockerfile, snpe1.41.0zip, two folders and two shell scripts.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the working folder
3. Run "./build.sh" from the command prompt.  The build process will begin.  An additional folder "studio-data" will be created to hold more files generated on the fly.
4. After the whole image is created successfully, use "docker images" command to show snpe-build-002 image in the local repository.

***********************
Run the Docker image
***********************
1. From the working folder prompt, run "HOST_DISPLAY=1 ./run.sh".  This will channel the UI of Android Studio to use the X.11 server of the host linux machine.
2. Follow the prompt of the UI to compleate the initialization and set up of the Android Studio.
3. Open a projec in Android Studio IDE to build
4. From "Help" on teh top menu, click "Find Action" and start "SDK Manager".  Go to "SDK Tools" tab and check on the NDK (Side by side) to complete the installation.
5. Follow the instructiion of SNPE SDK setup link in "Refreence" to proceed with more set up for TensorFlow and SNPE.  We must open a terminal within the docker container which is running the docker image.  THis can be done by using "View->Tool Window->Terminal (Alt+F12)" to open a terminal for console I/O with the Ubuntu 18.04.
6. Follow the process described in the SNPE SDK to complet the setup for TensorFlow.

This image currently has TF 2.3 installed.  No other framework is installed.
